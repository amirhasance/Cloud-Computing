## Introduction

## ðŸ’» First Project
This project makes us get acquainted with some ```Cloud Services``` like: ```Speech to Text```, ```Natural Language Understanding``` and ```Language Translator```. a lightweight backend and frontend should be developed and uploaded on cloud. And then we should use cloud services mentioned earlier in our code. In this project we should develop a website that shows movies and their names, director names, their logos and their comments in four various languages. And also we should be able to add comments and show them to users.<br>
